# Reproduceable Research Week 4

Literate programming view things as intermixed code and documentation.

R package "cacher" evaluates code and stores expression by hash.
Could even distribute "cacher package" to get analysis or just the
end products

Has some ability to trace the code to figure out what code created
each data object and the back dependencies

Has functions to re-generate and checksum and confirm each result
object.

Note: cacher is not in cran for R 3.2.5. Was removed because it was
not maintained as of R 3.1.0.
