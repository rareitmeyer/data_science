Principles of Analytic Graphics.

Rules on building data graphics (Tufte, Beautiful Evidence):

* Show comparisons. Evidence for a hypothisis is always relative to 
   another hypothisis.
* Show "causality" or mechanism or system structure. So show a plot 
   that shows particulate matter vs air cleaner, and not just 
   symptiom-free-days vs air cleaner
* Show multivariate data. Show as much on one plot as you can. EG, split
   up plots to show mortality by season, not all in one graph.
* Integrate the evidence. So use words, tables, diagrams all on one display;
   don't let the tools limit you.
* Describe and document the evidence. Show sources, save code.
* Content is king. If there's no story, there's not much to say.


Exploratory graphs are made for yourself.
* Understand data
* find patterns
* suggest modeling
* debug a study

Charateristics of exploratory graphs
* Made quickly
* large number are made
* goal is personal understanding
* axes/legends are cleaned up later
* color/size are primarily used for info

Even in EDA, you should still have a question in mind.
Even if it's perhaps a bit vague.

Can use rug with histogram or other graphs to show a bit more detail.

Use abline(h=12) to draw a horizontal line at 12.


Plotting systems in R.
* Base plots.
    * Artist's palette: start with blank page and add
    * usually start with plot and text,lines,points with commands
* Lattice.
    * Every plot comes from a single call: whole plot built at once.
    * Most useful for panel / conditioning plots.
    * But shoving everything in a single call gets hard.
* ggplot2
    * thinks it splits the difference.


Plotting systems

Base systems:

* graphics - plotting functions like plot or boxplot
* grDevices - device drivers like X11, postscript

Lattice systems:
* lattice: the graphs
* grid: the underlying graphics primatives


Base functions mentioned:
* hist
* plot
* boxplot. Takes formula.
* title
* text
* legend
* abline. Note abline can take a model, not just h or v.
* par. Note that setting mfrow lays out by row, mfcol lays out by column.

Good way to see pch values is
example(points)


Graphics devices in R.

Use dev.set() to change the active graphic device.

Can use dev.copy or dev.copy2pdf to copy a plot to a file. Not exact,
so better to re-plot with the intended target.
